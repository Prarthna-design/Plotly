# Plotly Dashboard

In this assignment, I created n this assignment, you will build an interactive dashboard to explore the [Belly Button Biodiversity dataset](http://robdunnlab.com/projects/belly-button-biodiversity/), which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels.

The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.

In this assignment Plotly was used to create an interactive Dash board!

The D3 library used to read into 'sample.json'.

Bar Chart was created using 'sample_values' as values, 'otu_ids' as labels and 'otu_labels" as hovertext for the chart."

Bubble Chart was created using 'otu_ids' for the x values, 'sample_values' for the y values and 'sample_values' as a marker size.

For Bubble Chart 'otu_ids' was used for the marker colors.
